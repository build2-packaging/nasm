* Upstream warnings
  On Windows the upstream code produces a lot of warnings. I've disabled the
  warnings about deprecated and unsafe functions because those calls have
  clearly not been left in there by accident and thus will probably not be
  changing anytime soon. However I am not disabling the warnings about
  potentially lossy type conversions because those might be serious. The ones
  I did check look like the developers knew exactly what they were doing but I
  do not have the time to check every one of the 60 cases so let's leave these
  warnings visible to users.
